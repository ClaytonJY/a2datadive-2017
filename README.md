# A2 Data Dive - 2017

The A2 Data Dive in an annual event hosted by the University of Michigan's School of Information and organized by a student group. Participants work with data from local community groups during a one-day event to derive value from the data for the community partner.

This year I worked with data provided by the Huron River Watershed Council. I documented my process in a [small report](https://rawgit.com/ClaytonJY/a2datadive-2017/master/analysis/README.html).

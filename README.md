# A2 Data Dive - 2017

The A2 Data Dive in an annual event hosted by the University of Michigan's School of Information and organized by a student group. Participants work with data from local community groups during a one-day event to derive value from the data for the community partner. Find more information at their [website](http://a2datadive.org/).

This year I worked with data provided by the Huron River Watershed Council. I documented my process in a [small report](https://rawgit.com/ClaytonJY/a2datadive-2017/master/analysis/README.html) which I've added a bit too since the dive ended.

The original version, completed during the dive, can be viewed [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ClaytonJY/a2datadive-2017/1e37e4a087c2cd5ee5370815a74ca393dc47a13a/Huron%20River%20Watershed%20Council/analysis/README.html).
